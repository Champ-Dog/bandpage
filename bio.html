        <h4>About Today</h4>
        <p>
            The National are an American indie-rock band, formed in Ohio, New York City, in 1999.<br />
            They have released 8 studio albums since 2001, as well as several EPs, special edition albums, and documentaries. Their first two albums released on Brassland Records, an independant record company founded by band members Aarond and Bryce Dessner. For their third album, the band signed with Beggars Banquet Records, as running a record company alongisde band and life commitments was becoming increasingly difficult.<br />
            <br />
            With comparisons made to <em>Leonard Cohen, Interpol,</em> and <em>Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds</em>; The National are known for their melancholy sound and lyrics.

            They supported both Obama presidential campaigns; performing at rallies, and designing and selling campaign shirts. They have performed and sold both records and merchandise in support of several charities. Also, in May 2012, they performed their song <em>Sorrow</em> for six consecutive hours at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, as part of Ragnar Kjartansson's project <em>A Lot of Sorrow.</em>
