        <h4>About Today</h4>
        <p>
            The National are an American indie-rock band, formed in Ohio, New York City, in 1999.<br />
            They have released 8 studio albums since 2001, as well as several EPs, special edition albums, and documentaries. Their first two albums released on Brassland Records, an independant record company founded by band members Aarond and Bryce Dessner. For their third album, the band signed with Beggars Banquet Records, as running a record company alongisde band and life commitments was becoming increasingly difficult.<br />
            <br />
            With comparisons made to <em>Leonard Cohen, Interpol,</em> and <em>Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds</em>; The National are known for their melancholy sound and lyrics.

            The National have been involved in many projects: political, charitable and artistic.<br />
            <h5>Obama Campaigns</h5>
            The National supported the 2008 and 2012 campaigns of former President Obama. For the 2008 campaign, they designed shirts with the slogan "Mr November" (a reference to one of the more popular songs from their first album). All money from sales of the shirts was donated to the campaign.<br />
            They also performed at a rally in their hometown of Cincinnati as part of the campaign.<br />
            From 2010-2012, they performed at several events in support of Obama, including a rally in his 2012 campaign.
